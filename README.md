# MultiProject
An assortment of small projects

Hopefully someday, someone will contribute!

Use the Virutal Env which should have everything installed.
In powershell change the current directory to the MultiProject
> cd "c:/path/to/project/MultiProject"

First install virtual_env:
> pip install --user virtualenv

Activate the environment:
> "venv_flask/Scripts/activate"

To Deactivate:
> deactivate

To Create your own enviroment: 
>python -m virtualenv the_name_of_your_enviroment

If you are using Pycharm, there is a way to get it to use your venv for running your programs
